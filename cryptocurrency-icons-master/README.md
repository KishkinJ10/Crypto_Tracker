# Cryptocurrency Icons / Logos + API
This are the original images from [coinmarketcap.com](https://coinmarketcap.com). Since they replaced all currency names with unique IDs, it's not possible to use their images anymore. For example "ethereum.png" is now "1027.png". This repository provides you with all coin images named by a "speaking" identifier.
